<h1>The Best Comedy Anime According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 comedy anime of all-times.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!</h3>
<p>The fantasy world vibe is really strong, and the character interactions are funny. The visuals are beautiful and incredibly soothing to look at.</p>

<h3>Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan</h3>
<p>The character interactions are hilarious, and the main character is super overpowered, but he just wants to live like a normal person.</p>

<h3>Gintama</h3>
<p>Absolutely hilariousâ€”hardcore comedy at its finest!</p>
