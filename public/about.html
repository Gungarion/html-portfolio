<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am currently learning HTML and starting to get interested in the world of web programming. 
  Even though I'm still at a very basic level, I feel happy every time I manage to make something appear on a web page. 
  Learning HTML gives me an initial understanding of how a website works, and it makes me even more curious. 
  My goal is to become a web developer in the future. I know the journey is still long and there will be many things I need to learn, 
  like CSS, JavaScript, and more. But I want to keep learning little by little, with spirit and patience. 
  I hope that one day I can create websites that are useful for many people.
